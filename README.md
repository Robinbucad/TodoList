# ToDo app using stack MERN and REACT 18

This project based on a to do App.
It is developed in React and TypeScript, using eslint and prettier to have a clean code, and I used SASS to layout the project.

I am implementing the testing in the application, and at the moment this is the coverage, which will be improved in the future.
To do the testing I have used jest and react testing library.
